## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2 Part 1

    This lab was fun because it was the first lab we coded. Using cin and cout, we created variables and inputted their values using the terminal. This lab was simple but showcased the simplest forms of coding, allowing for users to mix and match different words to fit the prompt provided allowing for an infinite amount of possibilities when this code is run. 

* Lab 4 Part 2

    This was my second lab because it was the first guessing game we made using if statements. Users would have to guess a number and would be prompted when they get it right or wrong. Having a number be guessed through trial and error and simple logic can be seen in other forms of media with similar approaches. Another reason I liked this lab was that it served as the foundation for choosing your adventure games because it had a prompt that players had to answer, and if they got it wrong, it could lead them to a different part of a story.

* Lab 6 Part 2

    This lab focused on blackjack, which was fun because I had never played or learned blackjack before, so it was interesting to discover the rules of the card game being implemented in code. Using different data types such as bools and ints we were able to distuinguish the different rules of blackjack through if statements. Although it isn't a proper example of blackjack, it still allowed me to think outside the box and think about using this format for other games that require cards. Furthermore, with the RNG system we learned later in the semester, it would be interesting to see how it would be implemented here.
