I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2026.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 2 Part 1
This lab was fun because it was the first lab we did this semester. Using cin and cout, we created variables and inputted their values using the terminal. This lab was simple but showcased the simplest forms of coding, allowing for infinite possibilities when this code is run. 

Lab 4 Part 2
This was my second lab because it was the first guessing game we made using if statements. Having a number be guessed through trial and error and simple logic can be seen in other forms of media with similar approaches. Another reason I liked this lab was that it served as the foundation for choosing your adventure games because it had a prompt that players had to answer, and if they got it wrong, it could lead them to a different part of a story.

Lab 6 Part 2
This lab focused on blackjack, which was fun because I had never played or learned blackjack before, so it was interesting to discover the rules of the card game being implemented in code. Although it isn't a proper example of blackjack, it still allowed me to think outside the box and think about using this format for other games that require cards. Furthermore, with the RNG system we learned later in the semester, it would be interesting to see how it would be implemented here.
